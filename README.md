# Movie_Search

This is a frontend development project I worked on using HTML + CSS + Bootstrap + Javascript.
The project is called Movie Search and it allows users to search for movies, to filter the results by year, 
and to sort the results by ratings. When a movie keyword is searched, results will display up to 3 pages max.

This project is inspired by Colt Steele's The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.

This project is mainly for learning purposes with the emphasis on the following Javascript concepts:
* ES6 Class
* Fetch API
* Async Await
* Promises
